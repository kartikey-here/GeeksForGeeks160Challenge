#You are given a 2D matrix mat[][] of size n√óm. The task is to modify the matrix such that if mat[i][j] is 0, all the elements in the i-th row and j-th column are set to 0 and do it in constant space complexity.

class Solution:
    def setMatrixZeroes(self, mat):
        rowlength = len(mat)
        collength = len(mat[0])
        row =[0]*rowlength
        col = [0]*collength
        for i in range(rowlength):

                    col[j] = 1
        for i in range(rowlength):
